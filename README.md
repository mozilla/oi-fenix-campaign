Setting up the server
-----

First install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then you can start the server with the following command. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your data.

```
$ git clone <URL>
$ npm install
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=<yourGitHubToken> docker-compose up
```

Now you can access the website for it at ```localhost:4000```.
